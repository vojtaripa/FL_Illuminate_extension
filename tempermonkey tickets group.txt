--------------------

- adding account numbers instead of business names for matching!
- if illuminate added those to listing it would be much easier to match SLAs
- changes to customers in illuminate outdates the OLD SLA sheet from ERIC (IN ARRAY LIST BELOW)
- any name variation, special characters, name changes, throw off search and results
- hard to keep updated with master list
- some dont even have SLAs in the list.

TODO:

In addition, if there is a way to create a ticket count >10days and >5 days and highlight the tickets.

>10 days highlight red
>7 days highlight yellow

Outstanding!!! When there is a platinum logo, is it possible to overwrite it with the letter? If not, could we just show the ranking in a different location, possibly the first column?

I would be interested in a custom user script for myself that removes the P1, P2, P3 and technician Count_Andrew.

The table would instead show:
1.)	Count of AAA, AA, A, B, C, D, E tickets – Filter available to sort by SLA Rating
2.)	Count of Manager, Director, VP, Executive Escalations

I intend on using this for both the NY West and NH repair queues.

I know this scripting takes time, please let me and Jeff know if there is anything we can do to dedicate time for you to focus on this.
******************************************************************************

1.(DONE) SORTING TABLE: working on sorting table not working in function
2.once headers can sort, need to create array of customer / priority object
3.search every customer against array and put results into "Platinum column"

4.BUTTONS: OLDEST TO NEWES TICKETS
5.         open all ticket displayed
6.         send email for followup
7.         PLATIMUN SORT (by what I'm creating above)
8.         BUTTON TO STOP TIMER

-(DONE) DROPDOWN WORKS!
-(DONE) clicking Tech WORKS!

-0. (DONE) fix green background
-1. (DONE) get time working...
-2. (DONE) Hover over row color needs fixing (cant do border on rows..)
-3. (DONE) make table headers stick, and only move body / tickets, keep headers where they are
-4. (DONE) make sure that header with totals does not get recolored / stays white...(add class?)
-5. (DONE) Joe and bill not working

-(DONE) Remove Expedite..
-(DONE) LOOK AT LINE 186 need to omit first row / search row...
-(DONE) click the Tech name to sort
